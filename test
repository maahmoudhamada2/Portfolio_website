create Project title="Simple Shell" technologies_used="HTML CSS JS" description="One of the projects I previously worked on as part of my software engineering training at ALX Arica was building a simple shell that mimics the Bash shell but with limited features Recently, I have had a few people reach out to ask specific questions about the project, and others want me to organize a tutorial session on it. Thinking about it, I realized that I had forgotten most of the things because I haven't been coding in C for a while now. As a result, I've decided to create a tutorial series on the project to help me revise the concepts and to assist anyone who needs it. I may eventually record a YouTube video on this, though."
